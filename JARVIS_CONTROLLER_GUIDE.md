```python
from jarvis_controller import create_jarvis_controller

# In your main app
jarvis_controller = create_jarvis_controller()

# Route requests to appropriate agents
if "project plan" in user_input:
    agent = jarvis_controller.get_agent('project_manager')
elif "content" in user_input or "blog" in user_input:
    agent = jarvis_controller.get_agent('content_creator')
